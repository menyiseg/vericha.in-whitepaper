##### Abstract

As traditional financial products become available in decentralized form on the blockchain, the decentralized finance (defi) ecosystem becomes only stronger.
A wider range of products allows for an exponentially greater amount of possible risk exposure, and thus, a greater demand for defi in the greater scheme of things.
We are building on top of protocols designed to create an open society. Peyote is designed to create liquidity in defi Credit Default Swap (CDS) markets by applying quantifiable supply to such products, while
concurrently empowering portfolio managers with access to a previously unavailable digital security. Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation (sCDO) products open the door for various new risk 
management opportunities.
